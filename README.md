# Image-Classification-Project
Implementing an automated quality control system to classify products as "defective" or "non-defective" using image classification. This project simulates the use of AI in a manufacturing environment to improve the consistency and accuracy of quality checks.

# Objectives:
1. Use computer vision and machine learning to classify product images.
2. Reduce the need for manual inspection and improve the speed of quality control.
3. Enhance product quality by accurately identifying defects.

# Design and Approach:
Step 1: Collect and prepare image data of products labeled as defective or non-defective.
Step 2: Preprocess the images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the dataset.
Step 3: Build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
Step 4: Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Step 5: Deploy the model to classify new images of products during manufacturing.
